# Evaluation Table

> **Purpose:** ADD results: for each architectural question, 2–3 candidate solutions compared on pros, cons, complexity and testability, and the choice made.
> **Authoritative for:** option comparisons. The decision itself is recorded in the ADR named in the entry.
> **Maintained by:** each module owner adds the entries for their module; entries are integrated after SA Review.
> **Last updated:** 2026-11-12

## How to Add an Entry

1. Copy the example below, take the next free `EVAL-NNN` number and keep the same fields.
2. **ASR:** list the requirements and the acceptance criteria (C-/M- IDs from `docs/req/requirements.yaml`) that shape the decision.
3. **Candidates:** describe 2–3 options; rate complexity and offline testability as Low, Medium or High.
4. **Choice:** name the chosen option and why it wins, say why each other option was rejected, then write the ADR.

## EVAL-NNN: <Question being decided>

- **Module:** <module from `architecture-blueprint.md` §4>
- **Owner:** <name>
- **Decision recorded in:** ADR-NNN
- **Status:** Open | Decided

**ASR**

| Requirement | Acceptance criteria | Quality attributes at stake |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-NNN | C-NNN, M-NNN | e.g. correctness, testability, cost |

**Candidates**

| Option | Summary | Components touched | Pros | Cons | Complexity | Offline testability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | | | | | Low / Medium / High | Low / Medium / High |
| B | | | | | | |
| C (optional) | | | | | | |

**Choice:** <option> — <why it wins>.

**Rejected and why:** <option>: <reason>.
